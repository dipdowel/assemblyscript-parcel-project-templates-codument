# TODO: Write a proper README for the Node project template


# Your starting point for a new AssemblyScript / WASM NodeJS project
- This is a template for AssemblyScript projects that use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a bundler.
- The template allows to have a working AssemblyScript web project up and running very quickly.
- Here's a [demo](https://wasm.codument.com/basic/) of the template project compiled.

## Quick start
1. Copy this project to a desired directory or use [the generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemblyscript-parcel-project-templates-codument).
2. Run `npm install` / `yarn`
3. Run `npm run start` / `yarn start`
4. Open `http://localhost:1234` in your browser and observe the console output
5. Edit something in `index.as.ts` and check the browser console again

### The Parcel transformer
This template relies on the [Parcel transformer for AssemblyScript](https://github.com/dipdowel/parcel-transformer-assemblyscript-codument).
- If something in the Parcel transformer  does not work as expected, please [open an issue in the transformer repo](https://github.com/dipdowel/parcel-transformer-assemblyscript-codument/issues).
- If you want to suggest an improvement to the transformer, please [fork it](https://github.com/dipdowel/parcel-transformer-assemblyscript-codument/) and open a PR.

## AssemblyScript
AssemblyScript is a programming language that allows developers to write high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) modules using a syntax similar to TypeScript. It enables developers to write low-level, efficient code that can be executed in a browser or other environments supporting WebAssembly. AssemblyScript provides a bridge between the higher-level world of TypeScript and the lower-level world of WebAssembly, making it easier to work with low-level operations while retaining the safety and productivity benefits of TypeScript.
Please see the official [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) site for more details
